# Jmix UI Samples

Jmix UI Samples is a web application that demonstrates usage of UI components, containers, facets, dialogs and notifications. It has also a "Cookbook" section which is a collection of recipes for solving typical problems related to UI.    

The project contains over 300 examples. We recommend browsing the examples online at https://demo.jmix.io/sampler. The application provides the hierarchical menu with search, descriptions and source code for each example.

See also the [jmix-samples](https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix-samples) repository for more complex examples of using Jmix features.
